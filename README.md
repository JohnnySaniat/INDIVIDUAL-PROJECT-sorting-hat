Description of the user and the problem you are solving for them:

Example 1: As a developer, it is important to understand the concepts of Array Methods, filters, bootstrap elements, refactoring, and loops.

Example 2: The user for my application is a Harry Potter fan who wants to be sorted into a house to emulate the books. 


List of features: A button that toggles a form, the ability to enter a name into the form with a randomized house feature, a filter to see who is sorted into which house, and an expel button to remove students from the rollcall.
